🚀 Capstone Project Completed – Python Fundamentals
I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed my capstone project focused on core data analysis using Python, Pandas, and NumPy! ✅

🔍 Project Summary:
This project simulated a real-world scenario where I worked with three separate datasets:
	•	Employee information
	•	Seniority levels
	•	Project cost & status

The goal was to clean, transform, and analyze the data using step-by-step Python logic — with a strong emphasis on writing efficient, well-commented code.

💡 Key Highlights:
	•	Created and cleaned multiple pandas DataFrames
	•	Replaced missing values using a running average algorithm
	•	Split full names into structured columns
	•	Merged datasets using relational keys
	•	Applied logic to add bonuses, promotions, and demotions
	•	Grouped and aggregated data to calculate total project cost per employee
	•	Filtered and analyzed based on specific text patterns (e.g., city names with “o”)

🛠️ Skills Applied:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Data Cleaning | Data Transformation | Logical Operations

📁 All tasks were completed inside a Jupyter notebook with clean structure and output visibility.

📌 This project strengthened my ability to think like a data analyst and prepare data for real-world business insights.

A big thank you to everyone who has supported my learning journey! 🙏
Open to feedback and collaborations.
